## Abstract
The necessity for accurate uncertainty quantification in machine learning is paramount across various critical sectors. Traditional models often fail to capture this uncertainty, leading to flawed decision-making. This article advocates for the use of Conformal Prediction, a robust and computationally efficient framework that offers probabilistic prediction intervals. Unlike other methods, Conformal Prediction doesn't rely on data or model-specific assumptions, making it particularly useful for high-stakes applications. The article provides a practical example to demonstrate its value in improving the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learningÂ predictions.
